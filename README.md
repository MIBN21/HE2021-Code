# Assessing Japan's Economy
Code repository for NTU HE2021 Public Economics Final Project.

By Irfan, Nickson and Kai Jie

## About the Project
This project is a simulation of Japan's population and to assess the simulated economy, based on a few metrics, before and after a certain tax and redistributive policies are implemented on the population. The simulation and analysis is performed using the R programming language.

There are 3 files used in this simulation:
1. [Income_Distribution(Tax Only).R](https://github.com/MIBN21/HE2021-Code/blob/main/Income_Distribution(Tax%20Only).R)
2. [Income_Distribution(Redistributive Only).R](https://github.com/MIBN21/HE2021-Code/blob/main/Income_Distribution(Redistributive%20Only).R)
3. [Income_Distribution(Tax And Redistribution together).R](https://github.com/MIBN21/HE2021-Code/blob/main/Income_Distribution(Tax%20And%20Redistribution%20together).R)

## Impact of Tax Policy
The impact of a tax policy implemented on the population is simulated and assessed in the file, _Income_Distribution(Tax Only).R_.

A consumption tax hike from 8% to 10% is implemented on the economy, which impacts the population based on the people's consumption expenditures. Here, we assess the impact on the economy and the metrics in view of the tax hike.

## Impact of Redistributive Policy
The impact of a redistributive policy implemented on the population is simulated and assessed in the file, _Income_Distribution(Redistributive Only).R_.

A redistributive policy was implemented in view of the consumption tax hike, and it is implemented by providing Â¥30,000 worth of vouchers for consumption to the lower income population in the economy. Here, we assess the impact on the economy and the metrics when the redistributive policy is implemented. 

## Impact of Integrating Both Tax and Redistributive Policies
The impact of integrating both policies on the population is simulated and assessed in the file, _Income_Distribution(Tax And Redistribution together).R_.

We attempt to simulate and implement both policies on the economy, and assess the impact on the economy and metrics, before and after having both policies.
